# SPATIAL TRANSFORMATIONS

## Frameworks

In robotics, a **reference frame** (or **coordinate system**) is a set of axes (typically **X**, **Y**, and **Z**) used to define the position and orientation of an object or a set of objects in three-dimensional space. It is essential for describing the movement and interactions of a robot, as it provides a context for measuring the coordinates of points, vectors, and transformations.
